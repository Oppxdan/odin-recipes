        <li>1 pound of lean ground beef (7% fat)</li>
        <li>1 large egg(1/2 cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fine dried bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 or 2 cloves of peeled/minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mayo</li>
        <li>4 iceburg lettuce leaves, rinsed and

        <li>1 firm-ripe tomato, cored and thinly
        sliced</li>
        <li>4 thin slices red onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg, onion, bread crumbs, 
        Worcestershire, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 
        teaspoon pepper until well blended. Divide mixture into 
        four equal portions and shape each into a patty about 
        4 inches wide.</li>
        <li>Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue grill over a solid 
        bed of hot coals or high heat on a gas grill 
        (you can hold your hand at grill level only 2 to 
        3 seconds); close lid on gas grill. Cook burgers, 
        turning once, until browned on both sides and no 
        longer pink inside (cut to test), 7 to 8 minutes 
        total. Remove from grill.</li>
        <li>Lay buns, cut side down, on grill and cook until 
        lightly toasted, 30 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Spread mayonnaise and ketchup on bun bottoms. 
        Add lettuce, tomato, burger, onion, and salt and 
        pepper to taste. Set bun tops in place.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your meal!</li>
